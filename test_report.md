# SystemVerilog Assertions Generation Report

Generated: 2025-09-01T14:40:11.066Z

## Review Checklist

Please review the following items before using the generated assertions:

### ‚úÖ **Mandatory Checks**
- [ ] Verify signal names match your design
- [ ] Confirm data bit widths are correct
- [ ] Validate timeout values (##[1:10]) match your timing requirements
- [ ] Check that reset signal (rst_n) is available in your design
- [ ] Review protocol assumptions (Request-Ack vs Valid-Ready)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Items**
- [ ] Adjust max_ack_delay if different from [1:10] cycles
- [ ] Modify data_width if defaulted to 8 bits
- [ ] Customize clock signal name if not 'clk'
- [ ] Add additional protocol-specific assertions if needed

### üîß **Integration Notes**
- All assertions use `disable iff (!rst_n)` for reset handling
- Signal names are normalized to lowercase with underscores
- X-checks are limited to active transaction periods
- Conservative timeout ranges are used by default

### üìã **Next Steps**
1. Include this .sv file in your testbench
2. Connect signals according to the module interface
3. Run initial simulations to verify assertion behavior
4. Tune timing parameters based on actual design specs
5. Add design-specific assertions as needed
